# 🗳️ Votelytics

**Votelytics** is a SQL-based project designed to model, manage, and analyze elections using relational databases. It includes database schemas, sample data, and analytical queries to extract insights such as winners, votes, and voter participation.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Votelytics/
├── DDL.sql               # SQL schema definitions (tables and constraints)
├── DataInsertion.sql     # Sample data for elections, voters, candidates, etc.
├── DQL.sql               # Analysis queries (results, turnout, margins)
├── ERD.jpg               # Entity-Relationship Diagram (JPG format)
└── RelationalDiagram.pdf # Detailed schema structure (PDF format)
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

* MySQL or compatible SQL database
* SQL client (MySQL CLI, DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, etc.)
* Image/PDF viewer for diagrams (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kps33/Votelytic.git
cd Votelytic
```

### 2. Create the Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE votelytics;
USE votelytics;
```

### 3. Load the Schema

```bash
mysql -u <your-username> -p votelytics < DDL.sql
```

### 4. Insert Sample Data

```bash
mysql -u <your-username> -p votelytics < DataInsertion.sql
```

### 5. Run Analysis Queries

```bash
mysql -u <your-username> -p votelytics < DRL.sql
```

## 📊 Analysis Features

The queries in `DQL.sql` return:

* 🏆 Winner per constituency
* 🆚 Votes of popular candidates
* 👥 Voter participation and turnout
* 🧮 Total votes received by each candidate

Optional extensions:

* 📌 Party-wise vote share
* 📌 Demographic-based insights
* 📌 Region-based turnout analysis

## 📐 Diagrams

* `ERD.jpg`: High-level Entity-Relationship Diagram
* `RelationalDiagram.pdf`: Complete schema with relationships and constraints

## 🧩 Customization Ideas

* Adapt column types for other RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL)
* Expand `DataInsertion.sql` with larger or real-world datasets
* Add views, stored procedures, and triggers for automation
* Connect to a dashboard UI for live visualization
